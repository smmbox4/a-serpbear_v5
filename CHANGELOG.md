# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. Releases now follow the conventional commits format but are managed with lightweight project scripts instead of `standard-version`.

## [Unreleased]

### Features
- Daily notification email now surfaces a tracker mini-summary ahead of the Search Console tables, styled to match the dashboard tracker card and only showing the Map Pack column when the active scraper supports it.
- White-label deployments can override the platform name and supply a `/app/data` logo that propagates through the UI, emails, and Docker environment defaults.
- Keyword ideas banner now offers an email action on both research and domain idea tabs, formatting selected ideas into a rich HTML table and bypassing notification throttling while still enforcing domain-specific recipients.

### Documentation
- Documented the fork's stability, security, and performance improvements at the top of the README for quick comparison with upstream SerpBear.
- Clarified that local development must use Node.js 20.18.1+ to align with the `.nvmrc` pin and dependency requirements.

### Build
- Adopted `@stylistic/stylelint-plugin` and upgraded Stylelint tooling to v16 so indentation rules continue working under the plugin namespace.

### Bug Fixes
- Expanded the notification email template container so digest tables render wider in supporting clients.
- Search Console digest tables now scope tracker-specific keyword column styles and apply dedicated widths so the label column stays left-aligned while Clicks, Views, and Position stack neatly.
- Clarified regression coverage to assert the camelCase `mapPackTop3` keyword property rather than the legacy snake_case flag.
- Tracker mini stats in notification emails stay side-by-side on mobile by removing the block layout override while keeping tighter padding for small screens.
- Ensured keyword refresh cleanup always persists `updating` resets even when Sequelize instances still hold stale values after bulk updates, so failed scrapes no longer leave rows stuck in a loading state.
- Cleared ESLint warnings by wiring width/min-width props into UI components, surfacing settings errors inline, sanitising SMTP TLS hostnames, and logging caught exceptions throughout Ads/Search Console utilities and API handlers.
- Fixed the Google Ads keyword ideas mutation so successful requests no longer throw a runtime reference error and now properly invalidate the cached query for the active domain.
- Tracker email summary now falls back to live keyword data to compute average position and map-pack totals, preventing those counters from showing 0 when domain aggregates are unavailable.
- Tracker email summary now respects persisted Map Pack totals when available while still deriving a fallback from live keyword data for domains without the stored value.
- Domain stats retrieval now omits average position and map-pack counts unless persisted values exist, avoiding stale recalculations from keyword snapshots.
